<p style="font-size: 22px; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">Khaptad National Park is a protected area in the Far-Western Region, Nepal that was established in 1984. Stretching over the four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti it covers an area of 225 km2 (87 sq. mi) and ranges in elevation from 1,400 m (4,600 ft) to 3,300 m (10,800 ft). Khaptad National Park was established in 1984 on the advice of the region's holy man Khaptad Baba. The renowned Khaptad Baba Ashram, a religious site where Hindu pilgrims come to worship Shiva on the full moon of July–August each year, is located near the park headquarters. A buffer zone of 216 km2 (83 sq. mi) was declared in 2006. Khaptad Baba moved to the area in the 1940s to meditate and worship. He spent about 50 years as a hermit and became a renowned spiritual saint.</p>
